# Hi there, I'm Mubarak! 👋
### Fullstack Engineer

I am a performance-driven software engineer specializing in **React/Next/Solid/TSS (TypeScript)**, **Cloudflare serverless architecture**, **AWS** and **Mobile (React Native)**. I build scalable, accessible applications that solve real-world problems.

Currently, I focus on building high-performance architectures that leverage the global edge to reduce load times and technical debt for clients worldwide.
